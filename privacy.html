<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 26 November 2025</p>

<p>
Thank you for choosing to use the Basic Calculator App (“the App”).  
Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about the information we do and do not collect.  
This policy is designed to clearly explain how the App handles user data.
</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
The Basic Calculator App is a simple tool designed for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The App works entirely offline and does not request or require any personal information.  
Our goal is to provide a safe, simple, and privacy-friendly calculator experience for all users.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, share, or process any personal or device data.  
More specifically:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>No personal information is collected (such as name, email, phone number).</li>
    <li>No device information is collected (such as device ID, IP address, or system data).</li>
    <li>No usage data or analytics is collected.</li>
    <li>No cookies or tracking technologies are used.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All calculations take place on your device only. Nothing is sent to any server.
</p>

<h2>3. Permissions</h2>
<p>
The Basic Calculator App does <strong>not</strong> request any permissions.  
It does not access your camera, contacts, files, location, microphone, or network.
</p>

<h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
This App is suitable for all age groups, including children under 13.  
Since we do not collect any data, there is no risk of exposing children's personal information.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App does not use any third-party SDKs, analytics tools, advertising networks, or external services.  
There are no ads and no external data transfers.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing and Security</h2>
<p>
Because we do not collect data, we do not share data with anyone.  
Your privacy is protected by design — all operations happen offline and stay on your device.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect improvements or regulatory requirements.  
Any updates will be posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised.
